### Discuss the two main CPU manufacturers: Intel and AMD   
The two dominant CPU makers are Intel and AMD. Intel's lineup includes the Core i3, i5, i7, and i9 series while AMD offers the Ryzen 3, 5, 7, and 9 chips. Both brands are excellent options for gaming PCs.

### Outline the common CPU series from each brand suitable for gaming: Intel Core i3/i5/i7/i9 and AMD Ryzen 3/5/7/9
Some popular choices for gaming are the Intel Core i5-10400F for entry-level and i7-10700K for high-end. From AMD, the Ryzen 5 3600 is a terrific budget option while Ryzen 7 3800X delivers fantastic performance.

### Recommend suitable CPUs for light, mid-range and high-end gaming  
For light gaming, the Intel Core i3-10100 or AMD Ryzen 3 3100 will suffice. The Core i5-10400F or Ryzen 5 3600 are great for mid-range setups. Top-tier CPUs like i7-10700K or Ryzen 7 3800X are recommended for enthusiast-level gaming.

## Picking a GPU   
### Explain what a GPU is and its role in gaming
The GPU or graphics card is crucial for modern games as it handles all graphics processing. Games have become more demanding visually, necessitating a powerful dedicated GPU.

### Cover the popular graphics card series from AMD and NVIDIA: Radeon RX, RX 5000 and NVIDIA GTX 1060/1070/1080 and RTX 2060/2070/2080
Some top AMD options include RX 570 for entry level, RX 5600 XT for 1080p gaming, and RX 5700 XT for 1440p. From NVIDIA, the GTX 1660 super, RTX 2060, and RTX 2070 Super are excellent 1080p-1440p cards.

### Recommend graphics cards that can run games at 1080p, 1440p and 4K resolutions  
The GTX 1660 Super and RX 580 are suitable at 1080p. 1440p is handled well by RTX 2060 and RX 5700 XT. High-fidelity 4K gaming requires RTX 3070/3080 or RX 6800/6900 XT level graphics cards.

## Selecting RAM
### Briefly explain what RAM is and its importance   
RAM, or random-access memory, is crucial for multi-tasking and performance. It is used by the system for short-term data storage and loading of programs and data being actively accessed.

### Recommend minimum of 16GB RAM with at least 3200MHz speed for gaming
16GB of RAM is recommended as the minimum for gaming these days. Faster RAM speeds like 3200MHz or higher are preferable for Ryzen CPUs.

### Note that only DDR4 RAM works for modern systems
Only DDR4 RAM modules are compatible with the latest Intel and AMD platforms. Older DDR3 RAM will not work.
    
## Choosing a Motherboard
### Discuss factors to consider when selecting a motherboard like CPU socket compatibility and ports
The motherboard is the backbone that connects all components. Key things to match are the CPU socket type like LGA1200 for Intel 10th gen or AM4 for Ryzen CPUs. Also check for needed ports like PCIe, M.2, SATA, and USB.

### Explain the role of chipsets  
Chipsets like Intel B365/Z490 or AMD B450/X570 determine core features supported. Higher-end chipsets allow overclocking and additional expansion. 

### Recommend considering upgrade potential when choosing a motherboard
A motherboard supporting future CPUs can allow component upgrades down the line. Consider features and socket longevity when picking the motherboard.

## Picking Storage - HDD, SSD, M.2 NVMe  
### Compare loading speeds of HDDs, SATA SSDs and M.2 NVMe SSDs
HDDs are bulk storage but slow. SATA SSDs are much faster. M.2 NVMe SSDs use the PCIe interface and achieve up to 4x times higher speeds than SATA SSDs.

### Recommend using SSD as primary drive and M.2 NVMe for best performance
SSDs should always be used as the main boot drive. M.2 NVMe SSDs offer the highest overall system responsiveness.

### Suggest minimum 256GB M.2 NVMe SSD for gaming 
At least a 256GB M.2 NVMe SSD is recommended as the primary drive for OS and games library. Larger capacites ensure space and performance.

## Choosing a Case and PSU
### Highlight the importance of good airflow and visible design in a case  
The case protects components while also housing fans to expel heated air. Popular options have mesh fronts, ample fan mounting, and side windows.

### Recommend wattage goal and 80+ gold rated fully modular PSU from reputed brands
A quality 650W 80+ Gold fully modular PSU from Corsair, Seasonic or EVGA allows headroom for potent builds. Modularity eases cable management greatly. 

## Selecting Peripherals
### Recommend mechanical RGB gaming keyboard, gaming mouse, gaming headset/headphones, monitor with 1080p/144Hz or higher   
Mechanical keyboards last long and feel premium. RGB adds aesthetics. Gaming mice improve aiming accuracy. Monitors with high refresh rates and low response times heighten immersion.

### Suggest dual or ultra-wide curved monitor options
Dual monitor setups increase productivity. Curved ultra-wides offer immersive gaming and work experiences in one screen.

## Considering the OS  
### Recommend Windows 10 as the OS
Windows 10 is the most compatible and widely-used option for gaming. It runs smoothly on various hardware.

### Note benefits of Pro version over Home  
Windows 10 Pro unlocks features like Remote Desktop and supports additional security options compared to the Home version.

## Planning the Budget
### Conclude by emphasizing creation of a budget before components selection
Carefully planning a budget before purchase ensures getting the best balance of performance for the money. Overspending should be avoided by prioritizing key components.
