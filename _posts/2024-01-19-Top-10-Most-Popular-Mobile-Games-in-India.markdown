### Free Fire 

Free Fire is one of the largest battle royale mobile games globally thanks to its accessibility on lower-end Android devices and balanced competitive gameplay.

### Clash of Clans

Clash of Clans remains hugely popular many years after its release, retaining players through long term village building and strategic clan warfare.

Its blend of construction, resource management and careful tactics have captivated Indian "clans" committed to strategizing together and dominating the competition.

### Candy Crush Saga

Candy Crush Saga helped popularize the "match three" genre of puzzle games on mobile. Players are presented with colorful candy-themed levels, each containing a board of candies that must be swapped and matched to achieve various objectives. Connecting three or more of the same candy type allows them to be cleared from the board. Later levels ramp up the challenge by adding new candy varieties and increased difficulty. Candy Crush Saga provides relaxing yet engaging puzzle solving, encouraging users to keep playing "just one more level". Its lightweight and instantly gratifying nature has resonated well in India, maintaining an audience despite a flood of copycats.

### Call of Duty: Mobile

The iconic first person shooter franchise has been successfully adapted to mobile by skilled developers at Tencent Games and Timi Studios.

A large 100 player battle royale mode called Warfare draws inspiration from the popular Battle Royale films.

Free Fire has found popularity among mobile esports communities as well due to its balanced and accessible gameplay.

### Temple Run

A landmark mobile game, Temple Run helped popularize the endless runner genre in 2011. Players control a character sprinting through lush jungle environments littered with obstacles. The goal is to evade dangers for as long distance possible while collecting coins along the route. Simple one-touch swipe controls made it perfect for on-the-go smartphone gaming sessions. Subsequent updates introduced new worlds and mechanics but kept the core pickup and play premise intact. Temple Run laid foundations for hundreds of similar games that followed while retaining a dedicated fan base of casual players in India seeking quick stress-free sessions.

### Subway Surfers

Following Temple Run's model of simple left-right infinite runner action, Subway Surfers updated the aesthetic to an urban graffiti theme. Players dodge oncoming trains and obstacles by swiping left and right as a character running through vibrant animated city environments. Powerups, cosmetic character customizations and leaderboards further incentivized replaying to beat distance records or complete objectives. Over a decade later, Subway Surfers remains massively popular for satisfying the urge for brief pick up and play sessions when traveling or having small breaks at workplaces or schools.

### Pokémon Go

Capitalizing on 1990s nostalgia, Pokémon Go brought the beloved Pokémon IP out of the Gameboy games and into augmented reality by utilizing phone cameras and GPS. Players explored real world neighborhoods, parks and other areas to discover, catch and battle virtual Pokémon appearing lifelike through their phone screens. Social features like team-based gym battles encouraged exploring together with friends. While the initial hype wave faded, a dedicated player base has emerged to routinely scan for rare monster encounters.
