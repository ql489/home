### Handling Mail for the Previous Resident
When you receive mail addressed to a previous tenant at your address, it's important to properly handle it so the sender can update their records. The easiest approach is to write "Not at this address" or "Return to sender" on the envelope and place it back in your mailbox for the postal service to return to the sender. This ensures the mail gets back to where it needs to go without any hassle for you.

While convenient, throwing away first-class or legal mail is not recommended as it could contain important information. Junk mail can be discarded but simple marking and returning is the safest option in most cases. You have no legal obligation beyond basic mail forwarding requirements.

### Contacting the Previous Resident
For mail from friends or regular correspondents of the previous tenant, you may choose to collect it and periodically drop it off with them. However, you aren't required to do this and it can sometimes be an unnecessary hassle. Marking the mail as undeliverable and letting the postal service return it is usually the least complicated approach. 

### Handling Important Mail
Use discretion with mail that appears important, such as bills, tax documents, or other legal correspondence. In these situations, contacting the sender directly may be warranted so they can resend properly if needed. However, your legal responsibility is minimal beyond the basic mail forwarding time period. As long as you aren't intentionally interfering, simply marking mail as undeliverable removes liability.

### Rental Property Situations
When renting a property, landlords should ensure proper mail forwarding information is provided to their local post office when a tenant moves out. This reduces unnecessary mail being delivered to future tenants. Tenants should also understand proper handling practices for any resident mail they receive after moving. With cooperation between all parties, these issues can usually be avoided.

### Persistent Mail Problems  
In some cases, mail for a previous resident may persist for many years due to out of date mailing lists that aren't promptly updated by the sender. While annoying to continuously receive another person's mail, simply keeping up the practice of quickly marking it as undeliverable and returning to the postal service remains the best long term solution. Directly complaining to senders rarely solves the problem permanently.

### Stealing or Destroying Mail
If a persistent issue develops where a previous tenant or new resident refuses to return mail rightfully addressed to you, this becomes a law enforcement matter requiring filing a stolen mail report with local authorities. Destroying or stealing mail can result in criminal penalties, so it's important mail is properly handled to avoid escalating minor disputes.

### Informing the Post Office in Person
An additional tip readers may find helpful is directly informing your local post office branch in person when a previous resident's forwarding period expires or an address change occurs. Speaking to a representative allows fully explaining any mail forwarding issues not being resolved, which they may then be able to more directly address with the sender. Community support is key to ensuring everyone receives their proper mail.

### Special Mail Contents
Use caution when handling mail containing personal financial information, bills, legal documents, or other sensitive contents. Avenues like securely shredding rather than throwing away are reasonable in rare cases where there could be risks to identity theft or privacy. However, for standard first-class or bulk mail, the tried and trusted method remains simply marking as undeliverable.

### Responsibility During Transitions
It's important to avoid confusion over mail handling responsibility during tenant turnover periods when addresses are changing. The safe approach is for outgoing tenants to cease receiving any mail themselves, while incoming tenants should wait until fully moved in before claiming what's delivered. Any mail received during transitions should just be clearly marked as undeliverable rather than attempting returns or forwards that risk delays. Communication helps ensure a smooth transition for all parties when addresses change hands.

### Summary
By taking care to properly handle mail addressed to previous residents, new occupants avoid potential liability while respecting privacy and security. The small effort of clearly marking envelopes for postal return helps keep mailing lists up to date. With cooperation from tenants, landlords, and the local post office, these issues can usually be resolved smoothly so everyone receives communications intended for them.
