### Understanding Where Storage is Used 
Storage space on a laptop is used in several key areas like the operating system, applications, temporary files, and user files. The first step is to check how storage is allocated on your device under Settings. This will show you a breakdown of where space is being used so you know what areas to focus on clearing space. Common space hogs include the OS, browser caches, downloaded files, and games or creative software installations.

### Uninstalling Unused Apps
Gone through the list of installed apps and remove any you no longer use. Large games, design software, video editors and other creative apps can take up 10s of gigabytes each. If you haven't used something in months, uninstalling it is an easy way to free up significant storage. Be sure to remove leftovers in Program Files as some apps leave chunks of data behind. 

### Using the Disk Cleanup Tool 
On Windows PCs, the Disk Cleanup tool can wipe cache files, temporary download folders, installers, error reports and more to reclaim storage space. It's surprising how much this utility can clear with just a few clicks. macOS has a similar Storage Management tool to purge caches and logs. Both operating systems also gain space by deleting system restore points or shadow copies backups if short on capacity.

### Disabling Hibernation
Hibernation is a power saving feature that saves the state of RAM to a file on the hard drive before shutting down. This hibernation file eats up storage space, usually a few gigabytes. If you shut down or restart your laptop daily, then disable hibernation as it's an unnecessary space hog. In Windows go to Power Options, on a Mac use Energy Saver Preferences. 

### Moving Files to External Storage
Move bulky file types like videos, music libraries and photo collections to external hard drives to get them off the internal laptop storage. Files you infrequently access but want to keep long term are good candidates for moving elsewhere. Cloud storage services or network drives work too if you access files across devices. Freeing internal space improves overall laptop performance.

### Utilizing Cloud Storage Services 
Leverage free cloud storage options from Microsoft, Google, Dropbox and others to offload files you don't need on your laptop every day. Photos, backups, archives and more can all move to the cloud. Configure selective sync to only keep folders locally you access regularly and move the rest online. When low on storage, purge synced folders from your laptop.

### Formatting as a Last Resort  
Formatting reinstalls the operating system and wipes all data, so should only be considered if no other solution worked. Make sure to backup important files externally first. You'll likely gain back all non-OS space, but it does reset Windows, settings, and installed programs which is time consuming to redo. Try other methods before such a drastic storage-clearing measure.

### When a Larger SSD is Worth It
For basic use like documents, email and web browsing, upgrading storage may not be necessary. But those who frequently work with large files like 4K videos, gaming, design or programming would benefit greatly from more SSD space. Heavier users seeing constant low storage warnings should consider a larger capacity drive within their means for better performance and usability.

### Combination Storage Options
A compromise is laptops with smaller SSDs paired with larger, slower hard disk drives. Common configs have a 128-512GB SSD for the OS and frequently used programs/files, and a 1-2TB HDD for all other storage. The SSD ensures speedy everyday use while the HDD expands total capacity at a lower cost than SSD alone. Checks file locations to keep the most accessed on the faster SSD.
