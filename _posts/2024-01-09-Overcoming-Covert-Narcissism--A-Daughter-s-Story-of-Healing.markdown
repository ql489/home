### Growing Up In A Traumatic Environment
Growing up, my mother's behavior had a deep psychological impact on me. As a child, I did not realize the abuse I endured from her covert narcissism. Her constant criticism and lack of validation destroyed my self-esteem. By adulthood, I recognized how unhealthy our relationship was and decided to pursue healing.

### Destructive Relationship Dynamics  
My mother played favorites amongst my siblings, scapegoating and targeting me for abuse. She was incredibly competitive and jealous, trying to sabotage my relationships. With no boundaries, she relied on me for emotional needs rather than fulfilling her role as a parent. The trauma of this dysfunctional relationship has lasted into my adult life. 

### Lingering Effects of Abuse
Internalizing my mother's criticism led me to believe the lies she told about my worth. People pleasing became a pattern as I sought approval. Past triggers would surface, bringing guilt over going no contact. Yet separating myself was necessary for my well-being and recovery from narcissistic abuse.

### Validating My Experience 
Researching covert narcissism provided understanding of the dynamics I endured. Joining support groups with others in similar situations brought validation. Speaking to a therapist helped work through childhood trauma and challenge the negative beliefs instilled in me. This path toward healing had only just begun.

### Learning Healthy Boundaries
 Therapy taught me how to recognize unhealthy behaviors and set boundaries. I learned that my self-worth did not depend on any person's approval. With time and effort, the effects of abuse can lessen their grip. While no contact was important, understanding the problem lay with my mother, not myself.

### Rebuilding Self-Esteem
To heal, I focused on my personal strengths separate from my mother's influence and criticism. Practicing daily self-care, validation, and compassion replaced her inner critique. Regaining a sense of self-worth independently has brought fulfilling relationships and life decisions.

### Moving Forward With Purpose  
Applying lessons from my recovery, I make choices centered around mutual care, respect and fulfillment rather than fear or scarcity. Sharing my story helps others survive toxic family relationships. Continued personal growth through education sustains my healing journey. Life is now lived with gratitude rather than being defined by past wounds.

### A Message of Hope
Healing is absolutely possible for anyone surviving narcissistic abuse. With support, time and inner work, the trauma's powerful effects diminish. Though no contact provided safety, the problem never lay with me or any victim. By prioritizing the self through compassion, wholeness and well-being can be achieved.
