## Notice Period Requirements
Most companies in America require employees to provide 2-3 months notice before resigning from their job. This gives employers time to find and transition a replacement. Shorter probationary periods usually only require 1 month notice. Unless approved by your manager in writing, it's expected that you serve out the full notice period stated in your employment contract or employee handbook.

## Consequences of Not Serving Notice
Failing to provide proper notice when quitting can have negative repercussions. Some companies may demand compensation equal to your unpaid notice period salary. It's also possible for former employers to take legal action against you to recover costs. You also risk not receiving an experience letter or relieving letter, making it difficult to use that employer as a job reference in the future.

##The Resignation Process 
 When deciding to leave a job, the professional steps are to inform your immediate manager and HR department in writing that you are resigning. Schedule a meeting to discuss your reasoning for leaving in person. This allows them to understand your situation and part on good terms. Be sure to thank colleagues for their support and time together before your last day.  

### Asking for Early Release
Some circumstances do warrant requesting an early release from your notice period obligation. Politely bring up the issue with both your manager and HR, and make a case for why an earlier end date is needed. Examples could include an immediate job offer, family issues, or relocation. Remain gracious whether your request is approved or denied - be prepared to fulfill your full notice if expected to do so.

## Bench Periods in Companies
"Benching" refers to when employers allow resigned employees to remain on payroll during the notice period but not actively work. This frees you to openly search and interview for new roles. Bench times make negotiating a quick release much simpler with your now-former employer. You may also be able to discuss continuing your salary if the company asks you to stay beyond your intended end date.

## Ghosting Your Job   
Simply vanishing from your job without a resignation is unwise and damages your reputation. Most companies will take all legal steps necessary to recoup costs from an employee that abandons their duties without advance notice. Consider how abruptly leaving could impact your career if former managers are contacted for references or background checks at future jobs. Honest, professional communication is always the best approach.

## Reconsidering Resignation
While rare, there may be times when changing your mind about resigning and staying in a role could make sense. Politely request a meeting with senior leadership to respectfully ask if reconsideration is possible. Weigh any commitments already made before prolonging your employment. If allowed to remain, get the agreement in writing as proof of your ongoing status.

## After Resigning
Your final weeks are a time to professionally wrap up work, return all company-issued equipment and documents, request copies of your personnel file and performance reviews, and ask HR for an experience certificate or settlement letter as applicable. Maintain a positive rapport, as former colleagues and managers may assist with future career opportunities through their networks.  

## Unique Situations and Exceptions  
There will occasionally be extenuating life circumstances that necessitate deviation from standard operating procedures. If you previously excelled in your performance and have their trust, discussing special arrangements candidly with your employer may allow negotiation of flexible terms. Honesty, courtesy, and good faith are still the best approach under any conditions.
