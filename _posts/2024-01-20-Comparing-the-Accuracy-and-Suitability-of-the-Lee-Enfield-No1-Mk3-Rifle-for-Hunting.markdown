### A Brief History of the Lee Enfield
The Lee Enfield No1 Mk3 rifle was the standard issue bolt-action rifle used by the British military from 1895 through the mid-20th century. Over 17 million were produced making it one of the most widely used military bolt action rifles in history. Chambered in .303 British, it helped equip British and Commonwealth forces through two world wars.

### Factors Affecting Accuracy
Several factors play a role in how accurately a rifle can shoot. The quality of ammunition used is important, cheap commercial ammo may not shoot as well as match grade loads. A rifle's condition and proper maintenance like cleaning also impacts accuracy. Using a shooting rest or barricade instead of shooting offhand allows the shooter to brace and steady the rifle. Finally, accuracy requires practice to develop shooting skill and precision.

### Achieving Good Accuracy is Possible
With high quality ammunition, a clean and well-maintained rifle, using a stable shooting rest, and regular practice at the range, the Lee Enfield No1 Mk3 can achieve satisfying accuracy. Groups of 2-3 inches are certainly attainable at 100 yards, which is suitable for hunting whitetail deer and black bear sized game within ethical hunting ranges.  

### Successful North American Hunts
Stories from experienced hunters show the Lee Enfield was more than adequate for taking deer, bear, elk, and other big game found in North America. Its flat shooting .303 caliber and 10+1 capacity allowed multiple quick follow up shots if needed on larger or dangerous animals. Canadian Rangers also relied on it for polar bear protection for many decades.

### Features for Effective Fire
Several design elements make the Lee Enfield suitable for hunting. Its bolt has a short rearward throw and prominent forward bolt handle for fast cycling of rounds. The 10-round detachable box magazine reduces stops to top off ammo and allows multiple quick shots. When the bolt is closed it cocks the firing pin, speeding reloads and follow up shots.

### A Time-Tested Hunting Rifle   
The rifle saw extensive military service proving its rugged dependability needed in the backcountry. Its accuracy was proven by target and sniper conversions. These tests validated it as a viable big game rifle when chambered in suitable hard-hitting centerfire cartridges. Hunters for over a century have taken all manner of plains game with Lee Enfields in both Africa and North America.

### Stigma vs Capabilities   
While some critique the basic two-piece stock or trajectory, experienced hunters know accuracy comes down to the shooter more than accessories. When chambered in proper hunting rounds and not just surplus military ball ammo, it remains a capable tool. Within reasonable ranges it could humanely dispatch deer, black bear, elk, and in colonial days was used in Africa on dangerous game too.   

### Recommendations for Hunting
With regular practice developing shooting skills, the Lee Enfield can take white-tailed deer, black bear, and other medium to large sized North American game humanely and accurately within its effective ranges of 200 yards or less. Choosing higher quality soft point hunting ammunition over military ball ammo increases effectiveness. For best accuracy, single loading from the magazine is preferable over top feeding from a full 10-round capacity.

### In Summary 
Despite its age and criticisms, the Lee Enfield No1 Mk3 maintains a place in hunting heritage and can competently harvest wildlife when practiced with and fitted with appropriate modern hunting ammunition. With care and the shooter's skill, it remains well suited to put healthy wild protein on the table in woodlands and bush of North America even today. While surplus military rifles, it has proven time and again a capable hunting arm.
