### A Standout Leading Man
Peter Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion Lannister was truly unforgettable. Over the course of 8 seasons he brought so much nuance, wit and complexity to the character. Viewers grew to love Tyrion, despite his status as a Lannister, because of Peter's compassionate and lively performance. His comedic timing was perfect, delivering Tyrion's sharpest lines with expert delivery. Yet Dinklage also showed Tyrion's vulnerability and capacity for deep emotion. Scenes where Tyrion mourns his lost love Shae or faces his father Tywin in a trial by combat are a testament to Dinklage's incredible acting abilities. It's no wonder he won multiple Emmy Awards for the role.
