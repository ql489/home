### Respecting a Parent's Authority

As a minor still living under their mother's roof, it is important to recognize the authority she has over establishing rules for the home. While disabling the internet access may seem like an overreach, legally parents do have wide latitude in deciding how to parent their children. However, open defiance and confrontation will likely not change her mind and could permanently damage the relationship. The wisest path is to have a respectful discussion expressing your perspective while also acknowledging her rights as your guardian.

### Understanding Different Views  

Taking time to understand each other's perspectives is key. Your mother believes attending church protects your moral development and spiritual well-being, which comes from a place of love and care for you, even if her actions feel restrictive. However, being forced into faith against your will may push you further away rather than bringing you closer over time. Calmly discussing how each of you see the situation without accusation can help build empathy and solutions both can accept.

### Finding Common Ground

Rather than getting stuck on doctrinal differences, focus on the fact you both want what is best for each other's well-being and your relationship. Could you agree to respectfully disagree on specific religious teachings but come to an agreement where you attend some services to ease her concerns in exchange for regaining internet access? Compromise keeps lines of open communication and allows moving past an impasse to more important shared goals of family bonds and future independence. 

### Demonstrating Maturity Through Open Communication

Prove yourself responsible and mature in other areas of life to earn back small freedoms over time. Volunteering extra chores around the house or taking on a part-time job are some ways to demonstrate your character is developing positively apart from religious observance alone. Continuing respectful dialog also strengthens understanding that demands cannot. As trust in each other grows through active listening and cooperation, further concessions may be possible.

### Seeing Alternative Influences and Short-Term Goals  

While internet access may be restricted now, there are alternative ways to access information and interests offline through books from the library, community groups, or outdoor activities. Respond to your mother's actions with patience and care for her well-being too rather than resentment, as any short-term inconveniences will pass. The health of your lifelong family bond is far more important than temporary dissatisfactions. Stay focused on long-term priorities rather than immediate resolutions.

### When Independence Arrives 

With age comes more opportunities to determine your own path. For now, avoid escalating tensions through openly defiant behavior, as forced belief helps no one. In just a few years, moving out on your own as a legal adult will allow shaping your future without constraint. Use this time to prove yourself a caring, principled person so she feels confident in your judgment even if privately disagreeing on religion. Where talks do not suffice today, independence may resolve what patience cannot for now.

### Prioritizing the Relationship Above All Else  

At their core, most family conflicts come from loving intentions gone astray rather than malicious desires to control. Religious divergences especially can stir strong emotions but need not divide if higher priorities are maintaining care, trust and respect between all involved. Approach differences with empathy, compromise where you can, agree to disagree where you cannot - but never let doctrines undermine the far more important bond you share. With understanding and patience on both sides, faith need divide loved ones. 

### Conclusion

Navigating religious differences within families takes wisdom, maturity and a willingness to see other perspectives. Prioritizing open communication, demonstrating responsibility over time, focusing on shared goals above doctrinal disputes, and respecting each other's autonomy can help bridge ideological divides. With care, empathy and compromise, faith variations need not damage the relationships that matter most. Through understanding and patience, what divides on paper often unites in practice.
