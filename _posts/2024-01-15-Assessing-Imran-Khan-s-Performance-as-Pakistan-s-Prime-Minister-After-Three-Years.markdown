### His Charismatic Personality and Anti-Corruption Campaign
Imran Khan rose to prominence with his charismatic persona and message of change for Pakistan. Commonly known as "Kaptaan", he campaigned vigorously on an anti-corruption platform, criticizing the establishment parties for misgovernance and large scale corruption. Khan promised to create a "Naya Pakistan" or New Pakistan that was prosperous, corruption-free and upheld the rule of law.

### Inheriting a Weak Economy with Large Debt
Upon assuming office in 2018, Imran Khan's government was confronted with a struggling economy. The previous government had left with dangerously high fiscal and current account deficits as well as a ballooning debt level. The economy was further weakened by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted business activity and exacerbated unemployment. Pakistan was compelled to seek another IMF bailout package to stabilize macroeconomic conditions. However, this led to unpopular subsidy cuts and tax increases further straining common citizens. 

### Domestic political Turmoil and Accusations of Foreign Interference  
Imran Khan's government completed less than half of its 5-year term before being ousted through a no-confidence motion in April 2022. Khan alleged a US-backed regime change conspiracy but provided little evidence. The move heightened political instability with Khan calling on supporters to take to the streets in protest. It also renewed debate around the military's outsized role in Pakistani politics and manipulating political outcomes behind the scenes.

### Mixed Progress on Reforms and Fighting Corruption
Khan's administration took some bold steps like arresting high-profile opposition politicians on corruption charges. However, critics argue this was more of a politically motivated anti-opposition drive rather than an impartial accountability process. Comprehensive civil service, judicial, police and electoral reforms promised by Khan progressed slowly if at all. While corruption at the top saw some action, petty corruption continued troubling ordinary citizens.

### Initiating Development Programs but Faced Implementation Challenges  
The government launched several programs focused on uplifting marginalized communities. This included low-cost housing drives, universal health insurance and initiatives to boost the skills and education levels of the populace. However, most schemes struggled with funding shortfalls, lack of planning and faced delays in rollout. As a result, many flagship welfare programs fell short of expectations in delivering real change on the ground.

### Navigating Complex Regional Dynamics and the Kashmir Issue
On foreign policy, Imran Khan had some successes in resetting ties with countries like China, Saudi Arabia and relations remained functional with the US despite tensions. However, Pakistan faced criticisms too on some fronts. Khan was able to place the Kashmir dispute squarely on the international agenda after India's actions in 2019. Yet balancing ties between the US, China and regional rivals proved challenging at times for Pakistan's interests.

### Legacy of Missed Opportunities but Remaining Popular Figure
While Imran Khan departed without completing his term, he energized Pakistani politics with a message of reform against corrupt status-quo parties. However, he failed to deliver effectively on his promises to build a "Naya Pakistan". The economy struggled more on his watch, corruption continued and living standards worsened for many. Yet, Khan retains passionate support particularly among youth and his PTI party still leads most polls despite the uncertainties over his ouster. His tenure serves as a cautionary lesson on Pakistan's fragile democracy and the depth of challenges it faces in achieving prosperity and stability.
