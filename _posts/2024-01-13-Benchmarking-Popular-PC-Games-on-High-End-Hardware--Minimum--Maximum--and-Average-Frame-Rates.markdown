## Introduction
Welcome to my blog post where I will be benchmarking several popular PC games on a high-end gaming rig. The goal is to test a range of recent titles and see how hardware performs across different engines and graphical demands. I will be using a GTX 1080 graphics card, Intel Core i7-6700K CPU overclocked to 4.6GHz and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. For each game tested, I will record the minimum, maximum and average frame rates achieved while playing for 30 minutes or more. This will give us a clear picture of real-world performance levels under extensive gameplay. Let's dive into the results!

### Doom
 id Tech 6 powered Doom for a rip-roaring ride through hell on Earth. Even with every graphics setting maxed, including texture resolution, effects and shader complexity, the game remained intensely playable. Frame rates were very stable, rarely dipping below 47FPS and frequently reaching over 90FPS. Doom is a technical marvel that really shows off next-gen capabilities. The frenetic action never felt held back by hardware. With such optimization, other developers should take note.

### GTA V  
Rockstar's open world epic still impresses years after release. Running on the RAGE engine, there are loads of options to tailor the look. I found the optimal settings balanced smoothness and rich visuals. Frames dipped as low as 16FPS briefly in the busy downtown area. However, averages stayed above 60FPS thanks to 8GB VRAM preventing major stutters. Unexpected dips occurred but were rare enough not to disrupt the fun of roaming San Andreas. Big, beautiful worlds can be crafted to perform well even on aging console ports.

### Just Cause 3
Avalanche pulled off another technical feat with Just Cause 3. Simulating full destruction of an enormous interactive landscape is no mean feat. Yet despite pushing limits, the game maintained averages of 55.9FPS. Frames peaked over 380FPS during less taxing moments. Only occasional drops below 60FPS into the high 40s occurred. Considering the level of madness on screen, gameplay felt remarkably slick. Later patches have smoothed things out further. It's inspiring to see how far engines like Apex can evolve hardware.

### Battlefield 1 
DICE continues refining their Frostbite juggernaut. BF1 is a visual showcase harnessing next-gen power. Averages of 55.5FPS were maintained through all manner of mayhem. Frames dipped into the low 40s yet kept pace with action. As one of the best optimized multiplayer shooters, the intense multiplayer never lagged or stuttered. Visceral WW1 destruction translated seamlessly to silky performance. Frostbite offers a shining example of how to achieve cinematic scale with flawless function.

### The Witcher 3
Few can dispute CD Projekt RED's mastery of open worlds and narrative. However their technical feats with WR3 are often overlooked. Pushing lows of 24FPS, it became the first game unable to maintain a solid 60. Averages of 39.9FPS demonstrate the visual splendor comes at a cost. Occasional stutters emphasized areas for improvement. But given the unprecedented scope and intricacy of WR3's world, moments of lag can be forgiven for the artistry achieved. Few games immerse with such nuanced detail.

### Arma 3
Bohemia is renowned for simulating massive interactive worlds. Yet realism often comes at the expense of smoothness. Arma 3 hangs around high 20s to mid 30s for averages and lows. Dips into the 20FPS range hurt fluidity. Across vast landscapes and intense combat, performance was steadier than Arma predecessors. But the steeper system requirements remind us that bleeding-edge realism demands cutting-edge hardware. Compromises remain for genres striving for full-scale verisimilitude over polish.

## Additional Games Tested   
Further games tested includes recent hits like Watch Dogs 2, Ghost Recon Wildlands and Mass Effect Andromeda. Performance varied depending on engine, effects and world design. While most retained fast-paced gameplay near 60FPS, others pushed limits showing work remains. Engines continue evolving yet stable 60FPS across all genres requires further advances balancing fidelity and efficiency.

## Conclusion
In concluding, this comparative analysis of popular PC games on high-end hardware yielded useful insights. Specifically highlighting how performance depends greatly on underlying tech like engines or scale of simulation. It's remarkable how far optimization has come maintaining smoothness amid visual splendor. Yet work still remains for some genres balancing realism with fluidity. Overall both hardware and engines continue progressing to new heights enabling immersive worlds at higher fidelity than imagined. Exciting prospects lie ahead as developers strive reaching photorealism seamlessly.
