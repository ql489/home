### Red Dead Redemption 2 - A Masterful Prequel and Story

Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption 2 is a true epic, telling a sprawling story across dozens of hours set in the dying days of the American frontier. Players step into the boots of Arthur Morgan, a senior member of the Van der Linde gang as they fight to survive against increasing pressure from the modernizing world and rival criminal gangs. 

The mission structures may frustrate some with their linearity but ultimately serve to propel the rich character drama and sweeping narrative arcs. Players form a real emotional connection to Arthur and other memorable characters that gives their fates real weight and impact. Exploration of the massive open world landscape is also endlessly rewarding, filled with hidden secrets and encounters that bring the Old West vividly to life. Though the story has concluded, many players still find themselves returning time and again to Red Dead Redemption 2's masterfully crafted world.

### Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - Varied Multiplayer and New Battle Royale Mode

For the first time in the series, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 launched without a traditional single-player campaign mode. Instead, Treyarch focused on refining their acclaimed multiplayer while also introducing Blackout, an entrant into the popular battle royale genre. 

In multiplayer, familiar game modes like Team Deathmatch are joined by new innovations like Control that change up tactics without feeling forced. Zombies mode expands the narrative arcs of past maps with new challenges for veteran players to complete. However, it's Blackout that truly shines - seamlessly blending the fast-paced combat of CoD with gameplay elements inspired by hits like PUBG and Fortnite. With extensive post-launch support also planned, Black Ops 4 shows that CoD can continue to evolve without relying on a single player component.

### Marvel's Spider-Man - Web Swinging Bliss in New York City 

Insomniac Games' Spider-Man is simply a joy to play, capturing the acrobatic web-swinging of Spidey with a level of fluidity and exhilaration like no other game. From soaring between skyscrapers to zipping around tight city streets, it feels incredible to traverse an open-world New York as the friendly neighborhood hero. 

The major characters are also brought to life in an authentic, heartfelt way through full voice-acting and motion capture. If the plot tends towards the overblown at times, it does pay fitting tribute to Spider-Man's rogues gallery and gives context for slice-of-life moments like helping citizens or stopping neighborhood crimes. With Poland a wealth of additional content and secrets post-launch, swinging through Manhattan remains as satisfying as ever - a true love letter to all Spider-Man fans.

### Divinity: Original Sin II - Epic Tactical RPG in a Captivating World

Larian Studios' Divinity: Original Sin II is unquestionably one of the finest role-playing experiences of this generation. Not only does it immerse players in a brilliantly imaginative world filled with colorful locales, factions and inhabitants, it populates this setting with a deeply engaging story focused on meaningful player choices and emotionally compelling characters.

But what truly sets Divinity: Original Sin II apart is its exceptionally designed turn-based tactical combat. Interweaving surfaces, line-of-sight, status effects and player customization results in beautifully deep, strategically rewarding encounters. Paired with the quality world-building and narrative weight, it's easy to lose dozens upon dozens of hours to this epic tactical RPG journey - a true modernCRPG benchmark.

### Guacamelee 2 - Clever Level Design and Humorous Hijinks  

DrinkBox Studios followed their acclaimed original Metroidvania Guacamelee! with an even wittier sequel in Guacamelee 2. Picking up the luchador-infused baton, it sees protagonist Juan reunite with new time-bending abilities to thwart a villain threatening all of Mexico. 

What makes Guacamelee 2 such a joy is how it constantly finds inventive ways to engage players through deviously clever level design. From racing challenges to retro puzzle rooms, it fluidly integrates diverse mechanics into the familiar exploration. Saving altered timelines feels as rewarding for experiencing marvelous level ideas as it does for rescuing friends. Paired with boastfully good presentation and humor, Guacamelee 2 proves a prime example of how to iteratively improve upon a fantastic formula.

### Dead Cells - Roguelike Action Platforming Blend 

Motion Twin's Dead Cells is a triumphant synthesis of multiple genres. Primarily an action-platformer with tight 2D combat, it incorporates roguelike randomness through randomized item drops and permanent death. This creates a tantalizing risk/reward loop as Biomes are re-rolled but progress persists.

While resets conflict with character upgrades, it all comes together seamlessly. Losing runs feels worthwhile in the pursuit of optimization and mastery as new tactics and builds are discovered. Substantial post-launch content also ensures Dead Cell's addictive formula remains engrossing. Above all, it excels at amalgamating these genres into a greater synergistic whole - raising the bar for future roguelike-inspired games.

### Onrush - Adrenaline Fueled Racing Unlike Any Other

Developed by the studio behind the cult favorite Motorstorm series, Onrush channels that same high-octane action ethos into a refreshing new take on competitive multiplayer vehicle combat racing. Abandoning realism for unrestrained exhilaration, races feel like dynamic rollercoaster rides as vehicles tumble and soar across off-road circuits. 

While variety is limited in the lower playercount Event Modes, "league play" Battle Mode ups the stakes significantly with its squad-based objective structure. It's here that Onrush truly sings, requiring skilled teamwork, strategic thinking and balls-out driving at breakneck speeds. With a focused emphasis on competitive eSports, Onrush carves its own adrenaline-soaked niche in the racing genre worth continued support.

### Monster Hunter World - The Series Peaks on Consoles

Capcom's Monster Hunter series has endeared itself to legions of fans on portable platforms over the years with its signature brand of co-op monster hunting. In Monster Hunter World, the series makes its console debut with improvements across the board while retaining its beloved gameplay loop. 

Massive beasts like Rathalos have never felt more ferocious to bring down, thanks to buttery smooth controls and breathlessly cinematic battles. A living, breathing ecosystem populated by wildlife makes the New World setting feel vibrant and realistic. Best of all, a robust suite of quality of life changes from equipment visual previews to SOS flares makes the game approachable and communal without sacrificing depth. As both a perfect entry point and new high water mark for the franchise, Monster Hunter World cements its place among the greatest of contemporary action RPGs.
