## Introduction
Gender composition refers to the number of males and females present in a group such as a classroom. This article analyzes different methods that can be used to calculate the number of boys and girls in various school classes based on given percentage information. Multiple step-by-step approaches are presented to solve similar math word problems involving percentages. Readers will gain an understanding of these calculation techniques and be able to compare different solution methods.

### Step-by-Step Method for a Class of 40 Students
For a class of 40 total students, it is given that 40% of the students are girls. To calculate the number of girls, take 40% of 40 which is 0.4 * 40 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 girls in the class. 

To find the number of boys, subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. So there are 40 - 16 = 24 boys. Walking through the calculations step-by-step demonstrates how to determine the 40% portion and then subtract it from the overall amount.

### Calculating with Percentages 
Another approach is to consider that if 40% of students are girls, then the remaining percentage must be boys. We know that 40% + 60% = 100%. Therefore, the percentage of boys must be 60%.

For a class of 50 total students, 60% of 50 would be the number of boys. To calculate this, take 60% as a decimal which is 0.6 and multiply it by the total of 50 students. So 0.6 * 50 = 30 boys. The remaining students not accounted for in the 60% must then be the number of girls.

### Using Variables to Solve
A third method introduces variables to set up and solve an equation. Let x = the total number of students and y = the percentage of girls as a decimal. 

If it's given that y = 0.4 or 40% of the students are girls, then an equation can be written:

y * x = number of girls

Plugging in the values where y = 0.4 and solving for x will provide the total number of students. 

0.4x = number of girls
0.4x = 16  
x = 40

Therefore, the total number of students is 40. Since we now know the total is 40, we can determine there are 16 girls and 40 - 16 = 24 boys.

### Calculating a Class of 50 Students
Now considering a class of 50 total students where it is given that 70% are boys. To calculate the number of boys, take 70% as a decimal which is 0.7 and multiply it by the total of 50 students. 

0.7 * 50 = 35

Therefore, there are 35 boys. The remaining students must then be girls, so 50 - 35 is calculated to determine there are 50 - 35 = 15 girls.

## A Class of 45 Students 

For a class of 45 total students, the percentages given are that 60% are boys and 40% are girls. To find the number of girls:

- 40% as a decimal is 0.4
- Multiply the decimal percentage by the total students of 45
- 0.4 * 45 = 18

Therefore, there are 18 girls. 

Next to calculate the number of boys: 

- 60% as a decimal is 0.6  
- Multiply the decimal percentage by the total students of 45
- 0.6 * 45 = 27

So there are 27 boys.

## Calculating Gender Composition for a School of 550 Students

Now considering a larger group, a school with a total of 550 students. The percentages given are that 40% are girls and 60% are boys. 

To set up and solve the equation to find the number of girls:

- Let x = total number of students 
- Given: 40% of x are girls
- 40% as a decimal is 0.4
- So: 0.4x = number of girls
- Plug in values: 0.4 * 550 = number of girls
- Solve: 0.4 * 550 = 220

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 220. 

To double check the work, calculate the number of boys:

- 60% of 550 is the number of boys  
- 60% as a decimal is 0.6
- 0.6 * 550 = 330

Since 40% + 60% is 100%, the totals of girls (220) and boys (330) should equal the total students (550), which they do.

## Half Method for a Class of 40 Students

Another approach involves using the concept of halves. If there are 40 students total in the class:

- Half of 40 is 20
- Half of the 20 students is 10 
- It is given that 10 students (which is 25% of the total 40) are girls
- Therefore, the number that are not girls must be boys
- So if 10 are girls, the remaining must be 40 - 10 = 30 boys

Walking through splitting the total in half step-by-step clearly shows how to determine the 25% portion without utilizing percentages directly.

## Conclusion

In summary, this article presented multiple solution methods for calculating the number of boys and girls in a class or school given total student counts and percentage information. Approaches included step-by-step calculations, using percentages, setting up and solving equations with variables, and thinking about halves. Being able to compare these techniques provides alternative problem-solving strategies and demonstrates there are frequently multiple ways to get to the right answer. The key is to select the method that makes the most intuitive sense or is easiest to apply for a given scenario. With practice, these percentage word problems can be solved systematically.
