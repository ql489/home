## Introduction
Plasma is one of the most common yet overlooked states of matter that exists all around us. Although it makes up over 99% of the observable ordinary matter in our universe, plasma is rarely studied or discussed compared to the more familiar solid, liquid, and gaseous states. This is largely due to its invisible and diffuse nature, as well as the misconception that it is an exotic phenomenon only found in outer space. In reality, plasma behavior can be witnessed all around us from fluorescent lighting to sparks from welding equipment. This post aims to demystify plasma and shed light on its captivating properties and ubiquitous yet lesser known occurrences. 

### What is Plasma?
Plasma is defined as an ionized gas that contains positive ions and free-floating electrons, making it electrically conductive and capable of interacting with electromagnetic fields. It is formed when a gas is exposed to sufficiently high temperatures, either through heating or the application of electromagnetic radiation like radio waves. This causes atoms to break apart into their individual protons, electrons and neutrons, separating them from their normal bound state. Plasma exhibits unique electromagnetic properties and behaviors not seen in normal gases due to this ionization.

### The Four States of Matter
Matter is commonly thought to exist in three physical states - solid, liquid, and gas. However, scientists recognize that plasma represents a true fourth state of matter. It comes after gas on the electromagnetic spectrum, with temperatures high enough promote ions over neutral gas atoms. Plasmas bridge the gap between gases and energetic states like Bose-Einstien condensates and photons.

### Properties of Plasma
One of the defining characteristics of plasma is that it conducts electricity very well. This is due to the high concentration of freely moving charged particles within it - electrons and atomic or molecular ions. It responds strongly to electromagnetic forces like electric and magnetic fields. Plasma can also exist in different phases ranging from cold plasma (near room temperature) to hot ionized gases within stars. The properties of a plasma are determined by factors like temperature and density.

### Occurrences of Plasma
Plasma can be found all throughout the universe, from the cores of stars to flashes of lightning in storm clouds here on Earth. Some more examples include the prominences and corona of the Sun, neon signs/tubes, fluorescent lights, and sparks from arc welding. Even the invisible solar wind streaming from our Sun out into the solar system consists of plasma. In industrial contexts, plasma is employed for processes like semiconductor etching, surface treatments, and waste destruction.

### Role of Plasma in the Universe
Given its prevalence, plasma permeates and shapes astronomical phenomena on both large and small scales. The visible matter in stars, galaxies and nebulae exists in the ionized plasma state. Plasma accounts for approximately 99.9% of the observable ordinary matter found within the universe. It plays a vital role in astrophysical processes like stellar nucleosynthesis, magnetic reconnection events on the Sun, and influences galaxy formation and evolution through turbulent gas dynamics and charged particle interactions. Certain theories also postulate that dark matter may primarily consist of cold plasma.

### Prospects of Plasma
Plasma science continues to reveal new potential applications on the engineering and industrial levels. Controlled nuclear fusion using high-temperature plasmas offers hopes of realizing safe and sustainable energy production one day. Non-thermal plasma assisted combustion aims to improve engine efficiency. Materials engineering and fabrication employing low-temperature plasmas help manufacture microelectronics, biomedical implants and solar cells. Space propulsion concepts like plasma rockets and plasma batteries leverage plasma properties for exploration. Growth areas point to an ongoing interplay between plasma research and technological innovation.

### Conclusion
Plasma permeates our universe yet defies our senses due to its diffuse and ionized nature. It represents the true fourth state of matter bridging between gases, energetic radiation and matter in stellar interiors. Although unfamiliar, plasmas underpin an array of processes essential to astrophysics, energy production and modern industries through their captivating electromagnetic properties. Our understanding of this enigmatic phase deepens with continued study, uncovering new potentials that will shape future technological and scientific frontiers. Plasma remains one of nature's great mysteries with many more secrets left to reveal.
