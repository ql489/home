### Era and team support  
Kohli and Tendulkar played in very different eras, facing vastly different bowling attacks. Tendulkar battled against the likes of Wasim Akram, Brett Lee and Muralitharan in their primes. Kohli meanwhile has faced the newer generation bowlers. Tendulkar also took on this challenge with less support, often shouldering the burden alone to bail India out of tight spots.

### Shot selection and style
Visually, their styles are quite different. Tendulkar was a pure stylist, his gently flowing stance and effortless scoring all around the wicket was poetry in motion. Kohli is more flamboyant and aggressive, playing shots hard and fast to all parts of the ground. Still, both displayed a vast array of shots to all areas, leaving bowlers clueless on how to dismiss them.

### Individual performances and impact
Some of Tendulkar's finest innings came in losing causes as he fought a lone battle to rescue his team from perilous positions. Kohli too has rescued India through stunning knocks even when the odds were stacked against them. Both could turn defeats into victories through sheer weight of runs and willpower.

### Handling pressure and criticism
As the flag bearers of Indian cricket for generations, they withstood immense pressures of billion-plus expectations. While criticism did not seem to affect Tendulkar externally, he was hurt by it. Kohli on the other hand is more expressive and vocal, using criticism as motivation to prove doubters wrong through performance.

### Records and accomplishments
The record books paint a clear picture of their greatness. Tendulkar finished his career as the leading run scorer in both Tests and ODIs. Kohli is not far behind and still actively playing. Other records held include most hundreds, most 50+ scores and more. Both completely redefined what was possible in batting at the international level.

### Leadership as captains and role models  
As captains of the Indian national team across formats, they led by example through their work ethic and passion. Off the field, they upheld the highest standards of character and sportsmanship, inspiring millions through their humility. They represented India and the sport with utmost pride and dignity.

### Overall assessment
While numbers point to Tendulkar as the greater player statistically, Kohli is not too far behind and still has chances to surpass some milestones. Ultimately, both are once in a generation talents who raised the bar for batting to whole new levels. Either of them fittingly deserves the accolade of the greatest, as one cannot be separated from the other in their impact on Indian and world cricket.

### Conclusion  
Tendulkar and Kohli's careers will be reminisced for ages to come. Future generations will marvel at their innings and strive to emulate them. Hard as it may be to choose, perhaps the best homage is that neither can replace the legacy of the other. Together they define an era of absolute batting brilliance and excellence for the game.
