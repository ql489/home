### The Sickle Cut Maneuver 
Manstein saw that the Allies expected a replay of the Schlieffen Plan and devised a deception to draw them in. He proposed sending Army Group B into Belgium as bait while launching the main attack through the Ardennes with Army Group A. This allowed Army Group A to cut off the Allied armies in Belgium, leading to their collapse in 6 weeks. The innovative maneuver assured Germany's greatest victory of WWII and changed the course of the war.

### The Epic Siege of Sevastopol
Sevastopol was one of the most heavily fortified cities in the world, ringed with bunkers and curtain walls. Manstein took command of the 11th Army tasked with capturing it by Christmas 1941. He found the direct attacks were causing unacceptable losses and halted the offensive. After withstanding bombardment and attacks for nearly a year, the city finally fell to German forces in July 1942.

### Holding off Soviet Forces
In late 1942, Manstein was ordered to save the 6th Army trapped in Stalingrad. With a depleted division, he engaged in a series of well-organized attacks against superior Soviet Forces. For over a week he methodically held off attacks and pushed back the enemy lines. His efforts bought time but could not save the 6th Army as the Soviets struck further south. 

### Stabilizing the German Lines 
In early 1943, Manstein stopped the Soviet advance and retook the city of Kharkov in his Counterstroke Operation. This helped stabilize the German lines ahead of the Battle of Kursk the following summer. At Kursk, he advised focusing the main attack in the north but was overruled by Hitler.  

### Orderly Withdrawal in Ukraine
After Kursk, Manstein conducted an orderly withdrawal in Ukraine against Soviet offensives. But his increasingly independent actions angered Hitler, who eventually dismissed Manstein in March 1944.

### A Respected Strategist 
Manstein was a master of deception, maneuvering the enemy into disadvantageous positions.  Through tactics like the Sickle Cut, he achieved victories against far superior enemy forces. He remained one of Germany's most clear-sighted strategists throughout the war. Manstein established a legacy as one of the most gifted commanders in modern military history.

### Post-War Life and Legacy
After the war Manstein stood trial for war crimes but was acquitted of direct involvement. He spent his later years writing his memoirs to argue for the ethical conduct of Germany's war. Despite controversy, Manstein remained a respected soldier and his strategies continue to be studied.
