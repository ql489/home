### Early Struggles
Installed Ubuntu not for gaming but still wanted to play games. Tried Wine and PlayOnLinux but games worked unpredictably.Tested other distros but Wine performed best on Ubuntu. Still faced issues getting some games running smoothly.

### Improving Performance on Ubuntu   
Uninstalled unused apps to reduce resource usage. Switched to lighter XFCE desktop from resource-hungry Unity. Considered running Windows in a virtual machine for most demanding titles to improve performance.

### Growing Linux Gaming Support
SteamOS provided a dedicated gaming focused Linux distribution. The Steam Play compatibility layer helped more Windows games run on Linux. The catalog of native Linux games continued expanding on services like Steam and Itch.io.

### Comparable or Better Performance Levels
Linux can run on the same hardware as Windows at native speeds. Driver support from AMD and Nvidia improved for latest GPUs. Removing overhead from Windows led to snappier performance on lightweight distros like Xubuntu.

### The Dual Boot Solution   
Partitioned my drive to install Windows and Linux side by side. Used Windows for newest AAA games through major stores. Linux handled most of my library, emulators and productivity needs. Dual booting provided flexibility for all my gaming needs.

### Remaining Roadblocks   
Anti-cheat and DRM technologies still blocked some online multiplayer games from working. Performance varied and troubleshooting fell to individual users. Porting efforts limited by smaller Linux user base versus Windows market share. 

### An Easier Journey Ahead
Popular distros like Mint and elementary OS simplified setup with one-click Steam and Lutris installers. ProtonDB and other resources helped test compatibility for more titles. Growth of the Steam Deck boosted interest in porting to Linux from developers.
